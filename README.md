# Robust-Digital-Watermarking-for-Color-Images-in-Combined-DFT-and-DT-CWT-Domains

Image watermarking focuses on hiding secret data into the cover image imperceptibly to protect the copyright of the original image. In this paper, we propose a novel digital watermarking scheme for color images using combined embedding techniques of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT). The cover image is first divided into Y, U and V channels. The Y channel is then transformed by DFT and partitioned into the ring shapes. With an embedding key, we generate pseudo-random patterns to represent the watermark. These patterns are also transformed and partitioned. The watermark represented by the selection of patterns are then embedded into the rings of the DFT coefficients. We further embed a rectification watermark into the U channel, in which DTCWT is applied to achieve a capability of geometric distortion resilience. On the recipientâ€™s side, the detection and extraction of watermark can be successfully done.
